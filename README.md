etcdctl
========

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/coreos/etcdctl.png)](https://travis-ci.org/coreos/etcdctl)

This is our spec/working area for a simple command line client for etcd. This client will be bundled with CoreOS. This is all brainstorming at the moment. Please contribute!

## Example usage

Setting a key on `/foo/bar`: 

    $ etcdctl set /foo/bar "Hello world"
    Hello world
    
Getting a key:

    $ etcdctl get /foo/bar
    Hello world

Deleting a key:

	  $ etcdctl delete /foo/bar
    Hello world

Tailing a key:

    $ etcdctl watch /foo/bar -f
    Hello world
    .... client hangs forever until ctrl+C printing values as key change

### Sets

`etcdctl` implements _sets_ on top of the key-value store that etcd
provides. These are useful for storing lists of unique items. A common
use-case is servers of a particular type that register themselves under
an etcd key, so that they can be detected and used by clients.

Adding members to a set:

    $ etcdctl sadd /queues amqp://user:password@rabbitmq1
    amqp://user:password@rabbitmq1
    $ etcdctl sadd /queues amqp://user:password@rabbitmq2 --ttl=60
    amqp://user:password@rabbitmq2
    
List all members:

    $ etcdctl smembers /queues
    amqp://user:password@rabbitmq1
    amqp://user:password@rabbitmq2
   
To delete a member:

    $ etcdctl sdel /queues amqp://user:password@rabbitmq1
